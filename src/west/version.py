# Make sure to update west.manifest.SCHEMA_VERSION if there have been
# manifest schema version changes since the last release.
#
# Note that this is the "logical" west manifest schema, and that the
# pykwalify schema doesn't capture everything. E.g. the map in an
# "import: <map>" is validated in west.manifest without pykwalify's
# help.
