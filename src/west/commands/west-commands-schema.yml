## A pykwalify schema for basic validation of the structure of a west
## commands YAML file. This allows projects managed by west to provide
## additional commands.
##
## By convention, this file is named west-commands.yml.

# The top-level of the file is a map with a 'west-commands:' key.  The
# west-commands key's value is a sequence of "command descriptors".
# Each command descriptor gives the location of a file containing west
# commands, along with the names of the commands provided by the file
# (and optionally the names of the classes which define them).
#
# Here is an example west-commands.yml file:
#
# west-commands:
#   - file: foo.py
#     commands:
#       - name: foo1
#       - name: foo2
#         class: FooTwo
#   - file: bar.py
#     commands:
#       - name: baz
#
# The meaning of the above example is:
#
# - the file foo.py defines commands named "foo1" and "foo2".
#
# - the "foo1" WestCommand implementation is just foo.foo1, but the
#   "foo2" command class is named "FooTwo". That is, foo.py contains
#   some code that looks like this:
#
#   class foo1(WestCommand):
#       [...]
#
#   class FooTwo(WestCommand):
#       [...]
#
# - the file bar.py contains a command named "baz", whose class is
#   bar.baz.
